We propose and compare two conceptually different models of the relations between different trust types and organizational commitment.?The main-effect model suggests that interpersonal trust and institutional trust directly and independently affect organizational commitment.?The mediation-effect model assumes that interpersonal trust influences institutional trust, which in turn affects organizational commitment.?Using survey data of Korean government officials, results of structural equation modeling (SEM) show the mediation-effect model is more plausible.?Findings from the Korean sample are successfully replicated in a sample of blue-collar workers gathered in the United Kingdom in 1973.
